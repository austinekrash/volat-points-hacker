# volat-points-hacker
description & preamble:

this python script uses your browser to automatically log in and read articles on the page vol.at\
[leading "news" site in vorarlberg (austria), consisting of 80 percent ads, 18 percent non-article-worthy posts and 2 percent real news]\
it does this to earn you "points", which can then be used to get some free stuff\

how many points can you earn a day?
- you can share 2 articles per social platform --> 4 platforms x 2 articles x 5 points/each = 40 points
- you can read 200 articles --> 200 articles x 3 points = 600 points
- you can click on 20 videos on the main page --> 20 videos x 5 points = 100 points
----------
- 740 points per day are possible to make the easy route

the script requires you to have an account on the site, you have to create one manually beforehand and change those credentials at line 30-40\  
you will have to install a lot of packages via pip, i didn't put them in a extra file cause i ain't your fucking butler or some shit\
install chromedriver at first too and change the path at line ~ 120 (search for "chrome" to find it)\ 

why the fuck am i doing this? why the fuck not.\
stupidity must be punished, that's why.\
if you can't secure your site against a shitty 19 year old script kiddie, who doesn't really know how to implement shit,
then you just deserve it, period.

enough talk. have fun :)
