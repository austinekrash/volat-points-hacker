# volat-points-hacker
description & preamble:

this python script uses your browser to automatically log in and read articles on the page vol.at
(leading "news" site in vorarlberg(austria), consisting of 80 percent ads, 18 percent non-article-worthy posts and 2 percent real news)
it does this to earn you "points", which can then be used to get some free stuff

it requires you to have an account on the site, you have to create one manually beforehand and change those credentials at line 30-40
you will have to install a lot of packages via pip, i didn't put them in a extra file cause i ain't your fucking butler or some shit
install chromedriver at first too and change the path at line ~ 120 (search for "chrome" to find it)

why the fuck am i doing this? why the fuck not.
stupidity must be punished, that's why.
if you can't secure your site against a shitty, 19 year old script kiddie, who doesn't really know how to implement shit,
then you just deserve it, period.

enough talk. have fun :)
